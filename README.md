## Goal:
There is 1786 participants on the competition. My goal is, in one week reach position 536 or higher (being in 30% highest scores). There are some people that has spent several weeks just to understand the data and finding patterns. Their findings can be found on Kernels and Discussion tabs. I will use their expertise and approach to solve this challenge in time.

## Steps:
* I've created a new environment called kaggle.tar.gz with all libraries I needed for this project. This environment was created with conda. As files weight is too heavy for GitHub, it will available in GoogleDrive.
* I've tried to open the file and it is too heavy (it have 48 columns and 13647309 rows). Having this in account I've created a dictionary that will specify the type of each column and will allow me to open the file.
* After opening the file, I start to inspect each column to know what I'm facing.
* Data cleaning.
* Save the file.
* Feature engineering.
* Create a model and train it.
* Additionally, for this competition the submission have to be made through Kaggle API, I will install it and make my submissions on that way.

## Files:
* Data files - Files weight are quite heavy, so I won't upload them here since are available on kaggle.
* Data wrangling - File used for loading the file on first time and for data cleaning.
* Data processing - File used for feature engineering, to develop the model, train it and make the submission through kaggle API.
