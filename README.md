## Kaggle competition: 
		https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation

## <font color=red>Goal:</font>
There is 1786 participants on the competition. My goal is, in one week reach position 536 or higher (being in 30% highest scores)

## <font color=blue>Steps:</font>
* I've tried to open the file and it is too heavy (it have 48 columns and 13647309 rows). Having this in account I've created a dictionary that will specify the type of each column and will allow me to open the file.
* After opening the file, I start to inspect each column to know what I'm facing.
* Data cleaning.
* Save the file.
* Feature engineering.
* Create a model and train it.

## <font color=blue>Files:</font>
* Data wrangling - File used for loading the file on first time and for data cleaning.
* Data processing - File used for feature engineering, to develop the model, train it and make the submission.
